## Design Reference

[Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/PL0JqbUXVJeGoFo6OHMeLY/Feeling-Tracker-Challenge?node-id=361%3A0)

## Primary Goal

Build a simple one-page app for tracking your daily mood, based off the design reference.

## Design & Functionality

- [x] Allow user to choose 1-5 rating for their day
- [x] The custom 1-5 input affects multiple components, refer to the designs
- [x] Allow user to enter and save a short message about why they felt that way today
- [x] When the user saves the card, the list item should update with the rating and truncated message summary
- [x] Saving the card replaces the save button with a saved timestamp
- [x] User can select a day to view and edit past entries
- [x] User can scroll horizontally without pagination for the current year (2020), starting at the current day
- [x] When user hovers over list items, the opacity of each list item is increased
- [x] Month at the bottom should update as the user scrolls in time

## Bonus Points

- [x] Save data via local storage
- [x] Add hover/focus states to the buttons
- [x] Add transitions for the card and list items on page load
- [x] Add transitions when switching between cards
- [x] Custom horizontal scrollbar implementation
- [x] Make this responsive
- [x] Whatever you think might make this better
- > Implemented Redux, Redux Thunk, Redux Saga for future tasks
- > Custom hooks, animations

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
